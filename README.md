# Java EE 8 Application Development
This is the code repository for [Java EE 8 Application Development](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/java-ee-8-application-development?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781788293679), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.
## About the Book
Java EE is an Enterprise Java standard. Applications written to comply with the Java EE specification do not tie developers to a specific vendor; instead they can be deployed to any Java EE compliant application server. With this book, youâ€™ll get all the tools and techniques you need to build robust and scalable applications in Java EE 8. This book covers all the major Java EE 8 APIs including JSF 2.3, Enterprise JavaBeans (EJB) 3.2, Contexts and Dependency Injection (CDI) 2.0, the Java API for WebSockets, JAX-RS 2.1, Servlet 4.0, and more.

## Instructions and Navigation
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.



The code will look like the following:
```
if (!emailValidator.isValid(email)) {
  FacesMessage facesMessage =
     new FacesMessage(htmlInputText.getLabel()
     + ": email format is not valid");
   throw new ValidatorException(facesMessage);
}
```

The following software needs to be installed to follow the material in this book:

Java Development Kit (JDK) 1.8 or newer

A Java EE 8 compliant application server such as GlassFish 5, Payara 5, or OpenLiberty

Maven 3 or newer is needed to build the examples

A Java IDE such as NetBeans, Eclipse, or IntelliJ IDEA (optional, but recommended)
