# Java EE 8 Application Development
This is the code repository for [Java EE 8 Application Development](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/java-ee-8-application-development?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781788293679), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.
## About the Book
Java EE is an Enterprise Java standard. Applications written to comply with the Java EE specification do not tie developers to a specific vendor; instead they can be deployed to any Java EE compliant application server. With this book, you’ll get all the tools and techniques you need to build robust and scalable applications in Java EE 8. This book covers all the major Java EE 8 APIs including JSF 2.3, Enterprise JavaBeans (EJB) 3.2, Contexts and Dependency Injection (CDI) 2.0, the Java API for WebSockets, JAX-RS 2.1, Servlet 4.0, and more.

## Instructions and Navigation
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.



The code will look like the following:
```
if (!emailValidator.isValid(email)) {
  FacesMessage facesMessage =
     new FacesMessage(htmlInputText.getLabel()
     + ": email format is not valid");
   throw new ValidatorException(facesMessage);
}
```

The following software needs to be installed to follow the material in this book:

Java Development Kit (JDK) 1.8 or newer

A Java EE 8 compliant application server such as GlassFish 5, Payara 5, or OpenLiberty

Maven 3 or newer is needed to build the examples

A Java IDE such as NetBeans, Eclipse, or IntelliJ IDEA (optional, but recommended)
